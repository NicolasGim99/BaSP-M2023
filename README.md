# BaSP Become a Software Proffesional-2023 



## Week-02

This time we had to start using **HTML** and codify what we did on figma the previous week.


One can start working on a **HTML** by different means but we are going to be working with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All we need to do is to create a new file with the extension **.html** (Example.html) and open it with  **VSCode**

With that we had all we need. We made use of different materials provided by **Radium Rocket** to work on our code.[UsefulMaterial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3N_BfRoy34ZgJZujENfuFOm-qxuko9T/view).

After that we used [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to save, share and commit the changes we were  going through. Then we upload them to [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

Following this [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/vGK-lWIs3sA) to config Git and GitHub. Making an online repository where our work will be saved.

Taking a look into **Figma** I started developing the webpage. Following step by step the design of the desktop landing page that was done last week. I focused on each and every part of the design and wrote it on VSCode. 

The main point was to make the basis of the page without the esthetic appearance part.
