# BaSP Become a Software Proffesional-2023 



## Week-02

This time we had to start using **HTML** and codify what we did on figma the previous week.


One can start working on a **HTML** by different means but we are going to be working with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All we need to do is to create a new file with the extension **.html** (Example.html) and open it with  **VSCode**

With that we had all we need. We made use of different materials provided by **Radium Rocket** to work on our webpage.[UsefulMaterial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3N_BfRoy34ZgJZujENfuFOm-qxuko9T/view).

After that we used [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to save, share and commit the changes we were making and going through we upload them to [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

Following this [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/vGK-lWIs3sA) to config Git and GitHub making an online repository where our work will be saved.
